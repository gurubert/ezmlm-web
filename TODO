TODO - ezmlm-web 2.3

DOKU:
- mention in INSTALL, that a missing webusers-file deactivates access control
- more documentation
- webusers is not mentioned in INSTALL

ORG:
- change ./lang/ to /usr/local/share/ezmlm-web/lang
- move unknown.gif to systemausfall.org
- some nice install method
- easy-mode? - maybe with typical profiles - or: separation basic / expert

CODE:
- check and improve DEFAULT_HOST
- check virtual user testing
- implement ldap authorisation
- check: the textfields for paths are filled with the first set value
- line 472 - replace "return" by "if"-construct
- check: safe removal of list (.qmail-* are left and dir is renamed to .dir)

LAYOUT:
- option for a css-stylesheet
- migrate header and footer in ezmlmwebrc to css
- improve css-design
- "prefix"-option should be next to its text field (as with all paths)
