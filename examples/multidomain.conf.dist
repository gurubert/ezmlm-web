# This is a configuration file for ezmlm-web setups with more than one
# mailing list directory.

# If you want to use multi-domain support, then you should somehow know
# what you are doing. You have been warned! ;)
#
# Usually you just need to adjust the $DOMAIN setting below.
# Use the existing example as a template.
#
# If your setup is a little bit more exotic, then you can change the code, too.
# In the end, the setting $LIST_DIR should either be an empty string or
# the path of a mailing list directory. You may also want to take care for the
# $DOTQMAIL_DIR, $MAILDOMAIN and $MAIL_ADDRESS_PREFIX settings.
#
# BEWARE: you may not define new variables as - otherwise they could collide
# with the names of variables of the ezmlm-web program.
