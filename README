II. Some Background
===================
[this text was written by Guy Antony Halse - the original author of ezmlm-web]
The need for ezmlm-web arose from the fact that we host many student
societies on our system. These societies usually have a virtual host for web
and email, which is administered by a computer rep from the society. These
computer reps often have little or no knowledge of Unix and so we needed a
user friendly system that would let the create and maintain mailing lists
(such as members@foo.soc.ru.ac.za, committee@foo.soc.ru.ac.za, etc).

Since I am never keen to re-invent the wheel, I had a look at Steve Peterson's
script (http://virtation.com/qmail/ml-sub), which allows people to subscribe 
and unsubscribe from mailing lists using a form->email gateway. This is fine 
for putting on a web page saying "here come and join our mailing list", but
doesn't really allow you to administrate a list.

Security of mailing lists was a concern, as we really didn't want
unauthorised people to be able to alter some users list. Ezmlm-web itself
implements no security checks (apart from un-tainting input) and so relies
on the web server to do this (re-inventing the wheel again :). We use an
Apache webserver, so one can control access to a directory using a .htaccess
file or in the access.conf file. ApacheWeek have a good article on doing
this at http://www.apacheweek.com/features/userauth. I also give examples
later in this document.

This version of ezmlm-web is based to a large extent on previous
versions that I have developed. It has however been totally re-written to
make use of the Mail::Ezmlm perl module I wrote. At the same time it was
updated and extended to include the new features of ezmlm-idx. It includes 
many new features that have been suggested to me over the last few months,
and hopefully is now useful to a much larger group of people.

Since 02005 ezmlm-web is maintained by Lars Kruse (ezmlm-web@sumpfralle.de).
Only minor improvements had to be implemented to keep the already fully
functional ezmlm-web up to date.


III. Requirements
=================
This version of ezmlm-web requires the following;

* qmail v1.03
* ezmlm v0.53 (or ezmlm-idx v0.40)
* clearsilver v0.10.2 (only perl support is necessary)
* Perl v5.004 and the following modules;
  + Mail::Ezmlm v0.07 (current version!)
  + Mail::Address v1.15
  + CGI v2.6 
  + CGI::Carp v1.06
  + DB_File v1.65
  + Getopt::Std v4.1
  + File::Find v?
  + File::Copy v2.02
  + Text::ParseWords v3.24

The version number indicates the version of the module that ezmlm-web was
developed with. Earlier versions may work, but then they haven't been
tested. Have a look on http://www.CPAN.org/, http://www.qmail.org/, and
http://www.ezmlm.org/ for anything you are missing. Of course, newer 
versions are expected to work as well.

To install perl modules you may use the cpan command line interface.
Just run "cpan" and type something like "install Mail::Ezmlm".

You can download clearsilver (a templating engine - it is required since
ezmlm-web v3.0) from http://clearsilver.net.


IV. Files
=========
In this distribution you should find the following files;

README			(optional) This file. Provides some background information.

INSTALL			(optional) Notes on installation.

INSTALL.clearsilver	(optional) Notes on the installation of clearsilver.

CHANGES			(optional) The change history.

UPGRADING		(optional) Notes on upgrading ezmlm-web from a previous version.

TODO			(optional) This file is a list of things I intend doing in future
			versions of ezmlm-web.

ezmlm-web.cgi		(required) The ezmlm-web cgi script in perl. You will need it :)

index.c			(recommended) A C wrapper to allow ezmlm-web.cgi to run
			suid. Not strictly necessary if your setup allows perl scripts
			to run suid, but I prefer using wrappers anyway. It needs to
			be edited and compiled to suit your system. Not needed to
			run ezmlm-web.

ezmlmwebrc		(required) This is the configuration file for ezmlm-web.
			All options are explained in this example file. You will need
			this file to run ezmlm-web.

htaccess.sample		(recommended) A sample Apache .htaccess file for controlling access to
			the mailing lists. If you use another web server, you will
			have to work this bit out for yourself.

webusers.sample		(recommended) A sample webusers file for multi-level access control.

lang			(directory, required) It contains the language files. You will need
			at least the one, that you have choosen in "ezmlmwebrc" by
			the option "HTML_LANGUAGE".

css			(directory, recommended) Here you find available css stylesheet files.
			Pick the one you like (for now, there is only one choice :)) and
			set it up by pointing the "HTML_CSS_FILE" setting in your
			"ezmlmwebrc" to an appropriate URL.

template		(directory, required) The clearsilver template files in this
			directory defined the layout of the web interface. You should be able
			to adapt them to your needs, if you like.

spec			(directory, optional) Some development specific information.


V. Notes
=========
* There is a function to delete mailing lists, but I really don't like the
  idea. The only reason I put it in is that bvi@rucus asked for it.
  If you set $UNSAFE_RD = 0 (the default) in the config section, the
  ezmlm-web won't actually delete the list. In this case it moves the <list> 
  to .<list> and all the associated .qmail files to a sub-directory called 
  deleted.qmail/ (In the users home directory. This is by far a safer way 
  (since you can restore lists) and therefore I recommend it.

* The HTML interface has been tested using Nutscrape, Internet Exploder, and
  Lynx. If anyone uses anything else and has problems, please let me know.

* I suggest that you make use of custom ezmlmwebrc files rather than using
  the -d command line switches - it makes fault diagnosis easier ...

* Please see the section on languages below.


VI. Multi-Level Access
=======================
Ezmlm-web has a multi-level access system. This depends on a file called
webusers being present in $LIST_DIR. If the file is not present, then ANY
valid user has access to all lists.  If, however, this file exists a number
of constraints come into place.

- The webusers file is scanned for either the list name (case insensitive) or
  an ALL (case sensitive) entry.
- The list entry (or ALL) is scanned for the current user (as set in
  $REMOTE_USER) or an ALL (user) entry.
- If any valid match is made, then the user is allowed to edit the list.
  Otherwise the user is politely told to go away ;-)

If list creation is allowed and the webusers file exists, then the person who
creates the list is the default owner. There is no way to create users
through the web interface, as this depends on your authentication system.

The format of a webusers file is as follows;

list1: user1 user2 user3
ALL: user1 user2
list2: ALL

Once this file exists, the ezmlm-web script will allow the list users to
configure their access lists along with any other options.

You can permit some users to create lists by adding a line similar to the 
following to your webusers file:

ALLOW_CREATE: user2 user3

If there is no line starting with "ALLOW_CREATE:" in the webusers file, then
no one will be allowed to create lists. This behaviour is new for ezmlm-web
since version 2.2. To stay compatible to old installations, the commandline
option "-c" for ezmlm-web.cgi will still allow everyone to create lists. The
use of this option is deprecated, since the line "ALLOW_CREATE: ALL" provides
the same effect in a cleaner way.


VII. Language Portablity
=========================
One of the great new features of version 2.0 is that it is essentially
language independant. All of the fixed strings, help, etc is defined in the
files of lang directory. Of course you can change them or create a new
translation.

The language can be selected in ezmlmwebrc with the "HTML_LANGUAGE" option.

If anyone gets round to writing full templates for languages I would
appreciate it if you would do two things;

Firstly, make them public and announce them on the ezmlm@lists.cr.yp.to
mailing list so that others may benefit.

Secondly, please mail me a copy (ezmlm-web@sumpfralle.de) so that I may use
them in any future releases of ezmlm-web.


VIII. Bugs && Bug Reports
=======================
I don't know of any bugs, but then this is a rewrite and a first release. It
has been tested reasonably well, but not exhaustively. I know it works on
FreeBSD 4.0-STABLE, FreeBSD 3.4-RELEASE, RedHat 5.1, Redhat 6.0 and Debian
3.0 all using an Apache web server, but I would be interested to know whether
it works on other OSs and with other web servers.

Please mail bug reports and comments to ezmlm-web@sumpfralle.de.
Or (even better) submit a bug report at https://systemausfall.org/trac/ezmlm-web.
Or subscribe to the ezmlm-web mailinglist: ezmlm-web-subscribe@lists.systemausfall.org.
