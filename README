II. Requirements
================
This version of ezmlm-web requires the following;

* qmail v1.03
* ezmlm-idx v0.40 or higher
* clearsilver v0.10.3 (only perl support is necessary)
* Perl v5.004 and the following modules;
  + Mail::Ezmlm v0.07
  + Mail::Address v1.15 OR Email::Address
  + CGI v2.6 
  + CGI::Carp v1.06
  + DB_File v1.65
  + Getopt::Std v4.1
  + File::Find v?
  + File::Copy v2.02
  + File::Path v1.07
  + Text::ParseWords v3.24
  + MIME::QuotedPrint v?
  + Encode (optional)

The version number indicates the version of the module that ezmlm-web was
developed with. Earlier versions may work, but then they haven't been
tested. Have a look on http://www.CPAN.org/, http://www.qmail.org/, and
http://www.ezmlm.org/ for anything you are missing. Of course, newer 
versions are expected to work as well.

To install perl modules you may use the cpan command line interface.
Just run "cpan" and type something like "install Mail::Ezmlm".

You can download clearsilver (a templating engine) from http://clearsilver.net.


III. Multi-Level Access
=======================
Ezmlm-web has a multi-level access system. This depends on a file called
webusers being present in $LIST_DIR. If the file is not present, then NO
user has access to any list. In other words: this file is mandatory.

- The webusers file is scanned for either the list name (case insensitive) or
  an ALL (case sensitive) entry.
- The list entry (or ALL) is scanned for the current user (as set in
  $REMOTE_USER) or an ALL (user) entry.
- If any valid match is made, then the user is allowed to edit the list.
  Otherwise the user is politely told to go away ;-)

If list creation is allowed and the webusers file exists, then the person who
creates the list is the default owner. There is no way to create users
through the web interface, as this depends on your authentication system.

The format of a webusers file is as follows:

    list1: user1 user2 user3
    ALL: user1 user2
    list2: ALL

Once this file exists, the ezmlm-web script will allow the list users to
configure their access lists along with any other options.

You can permit some users to create lists by adding a line similar to the 
following to your webusers file:

    ALLOW_CREATE: user2 user3

If there is no line starting with "ALLOW_CREATE:" in the webusers file, then
no one will be allowed to create lists. This behaviour is new for ezmlm-web
since version 2.2. To stay compatible to old installations, the commandline
option "-c" for ezmlm-web.cgi will still allow everyone to create lists. The
use of this option is deprecated, since the line "ALLOW_CREATE: ALL" provides
the same effect in a cleaner way.

You find the details of the format of webusers (5) file in the respective
manpage.

If you just want to have the most simply (and most dangerous) access settings,
then you could just use the following as a starter:

    ALL: ALL
    ALLOW_CREATE: ALL


IV. Multilingual interface
==========================
One of the great new features since version 2.0 is that it is essentially
language independant. All of the fixed strings, help, etc is defined in the
files of the lang directory. Of course you can change them or create a new
translation.

The default fallback language can be selected in ezmlmwebrc with the
"HTML_LANGUAGE" option. ezmlm-web tries to determine the language of the
current user by evaluating the http header information of the browser.
Additionally the user may select a different language via the web interface.

The currently supported languages are:
 - English
 - German
 - Slovenian
 - Portuguese (Brazil)

Please visit the translation center at http://translate.systemausfall.org
to contribute some translations for your native language. Thanks!


V. Encryption support
=====================

ezmlm-web supports encrypted mailinglists since v3.3.
See README.crypto for details.


VI. Bugs && Bug Reports
=======================
I don't know of any bugs ...
Ezmlm-web has been tested reasonably well, but not exhaustively. I know it
works on FreeBSD 4.0-STABLE, FreeBSD 3.4-RELEASE, RedHat 5.1, Redhat 6.0 and
Debian all using an Apache web server, but I would be interested to know
whether it works on other OSs and with other web servers.

Please mail bug reports and comments to
	ezmlm-web@sumpfralle.de
Or (even better) submit a bug report at
	https://systemausfall.org/trac/ezmlm-web
Or subscribe to the ezmlm-web mailinglist:
	ezmlm-web-subscribe@lists.systemausfall.org
