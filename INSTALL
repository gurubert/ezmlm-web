------------------------------------------------------------------------------


0.	IMPORTANT: you need the perl module Mail::Ezmlm and others to use 
	ezmlm-web! The file README contains the complete list of necessary
	modules.


1.	Choose a distribution form

1a)	source installation
	Get ezmlm-web and extract the archive:
		tar xzf ezmlm-web-3.x.tar.gz
	 (for source installation continue with step 2)

1b)	debian package
	This is the (by far) most convenient way to install ezmlm-web.
	Read debian/README.Debian for details.
	(debian users may stop reading here)


2.	Execute the following lines to install the cgi script and the shared data
	files to the appropriate locations.
		perl Makefile.PL
		make
		make install


3.	Edit the examples/ezmlmwebrc.dist file and alter the variables to suit
	your particular system.
     
	Be careful about the $LIST_DIR variable. This script assumes that
	all users store their mailing lists in the same sub directory of the
	home directory (eg ~/lists). You can override this for an individual
	user by recompiling the C wrapper to call ezmlm-web.cgi with a -d
	option.

	Other configurable options are documented in the ezmlmwebrc file
	itself. I have tried to keep the amount of information that you need to
	supply to a minimum and also make reasonable guesses about default
	values.

	Finally, copy the ezmlmwebrc file to one of
	the following places:
		1) the home directory of the user that runs ezmlm-web.cgi (~/.ezmlmwebrc)
		2) /etc/ezmlm-web/ezmlmwebrc
		3) /etc/ezmlm/ezmlmwebrc [deprecated]
	 (ezmlm-web will look for it in these places in the given order)
	
	See the manpage of ezmlmwebrc (5) for a complete description of all
	configuration settings.


4.	For every user/virtual host that needs to manage mailing lists, you
	need to create a suid wrapper owned by the user whom the mailing lists
	belong to. This wrapper needs to reside somewhere accessible by 
	the web server. I suggest that you put it in a sub directory 
	of each user/virtual host's home directory (eg.
	/home/luser/public_html/ezmlm for Apache). 

	Create a suid wrapper by issuing the following command:
		ezmlm-web-make-suid 

	The copies don't actually have to be called index.cgi, but it is nice
	for web servers that can resolve a cgi script as an index page. It is
	important to make sure that whichever directory you choose to put them can
		i:	Execute CGI Scripts and
		ii:	Be access controlled (here I mean both web and user access) by
			some method (eg .htaccess for Apache).
	
	Alternatively you can also manage multiple domains/users/virtual hosts
	with a single suid-wrapper. Take a look at examples/multidomain.conf for
	details.


5.	Install some method of securing access to the page. The following
	information is applicable to Apache web servers ... Detailed
	information on user authentication can be obtained from the Apache
	documentation (http://www.apache.org) and ApacheWeek
	(http://www.apacheweek.com/features/userauth).

5.1	Ensure that your Apache setup will allow .htaccess file to control
	access in the directory that contains. This is controlled by the
	AllowOverride tag in access.conf. (Also ensure you have the
	necessary Apache modules installed)

5.2	Create a htpasswd file. This is done using the htpasswd command that
	comes with Apache. Its command line syntax is;
		htpasswd [-c] passwordfile username
   
	You need to put the passwordfile somewhere that is not accessible by
	people through the web, and create an entry for each user you want
	to have access ... See the ApacheWeek article for more details.

5.3	Create a .htaccess file in the directory that contains index.cgi.
	Note that using Apache's built in access control, you can only control
	access to directories, not individual files, hence the need for a
	sub-directory in step 5.

	The format of the .htaccess file should be along the lines of this;

		AuthName EZ Mailing List Manager
		AuthType Basic
		AuthUserFile /path/to/passwordfile
		require valid-user      # or require user username
	
	You may use examples/htaccess.dist as a template.

	Again, see the ApacheWeek article for details.


6.	You may skip this step if you manage only one directory containing mailing
	lists. For more than one domain or multiple user directories you should
	follow the instructions below. BEWARE: this is an advanced setting.

	1) copy examples/multidomain.conf.dist to /etc/ezmlm-web/multidomain.conf
	2) add your mailing list parent directories to this file
	3) uncomment the respective line in your ezmlmwebrc file

	The web interface should now show a "Change domain" link in the navigation
	bar to the left.

	Direct links to a specifc domain use the following format:
		http://BASE_URL/ezmlm-web?domain=foo
	
	Note that since version 3.3 webusers file has to explictly let users create 
	and manage lists. If you are relying on the user beeing able to create lists 
	if no webusers file exists, then you will have to explicitly create one with
	the appropiate permissions.

7.	Copy the stylesheet files (/usr/local/share/ezmlm-web/www-data/*.css)
	to a location of your choice. It has to be accessible by an URL - maybe
	a place like "/var/www/ezmlm-web/" could be appropriate.
	Now you may have to adapt the "HTML_CSS_COMMON" and "HTML_CSS_COLOR"
	settings in your ezmlmwebrc file.

	Alternatively you can also use the mapping feature of your web server.
	Take a look at examples/apache.conf.dist for an example.


8.  Test the installation with your favourite web browser. You should be
	asked for a username and password (supplied in 6.2) and then be presented
	with a screen entitled "ezmlm-web". You can then try to create and edit
	mailing lists ... Have Fun :)

	If you see a slightly disordered screen, the you probably did not set the
	HTML_CSS_COMMON option correctly. Check it again.

	If you do not see a colorful screen, then you probably did not set the
	HTML_CSS_COLOR option correctly. Check it again.


9.	If anything failes - take a look at the web server's error log
	(e.g. /var/log/apache/error.log).


10.	If the error log of your web server does not to solve your problem:
	- take a look at https://systemausfall.org/toolforge/ezmlm-web
	- subscribe to the mailinglist: ezmlm-web-subscribe@lists.systemausfall.org
	- send me an email: ezmlm-web@sumpfralle.de
	- report a bug at https://systemausfall.org/trac/ezmlm-web
